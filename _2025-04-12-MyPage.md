I am a methodical and resilient learner, driven by curiosity and a commitment to building systems that make a difference. My approach to technology is structured and step-by-step, allowing me to tackle challenges with patience and a growth mindset.

Currently, I am developing foundational skills in ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core, focusing on creating meaningful applications like BloodBridge—a blood donation platform designed to address real-world healthcare needs. I thrive in environments that demand persistence and adaptability, whether it’s configuring development environments, resolving navigation and database mapping issues, or rebuilding projects from scratch. For me, setbacks are opportunities to deepen my understanding, and I embrace starting over if it means mastering a concept thoroughly.

My passion for web development is evident in my hands-on, practical approach. I enjoy dissecting systems, understanding how components interact, and refining interfaces to enhance user experience. I am especially interested in modular design, responsive UI/UX, and accessibility, ensuring the solutions I build are inclusive and intuitive.

Alongside web development, I am cultivating a strong interest in data science. I recognize its power to uncover insights and drive informed decisions. I am exploring tools like Power BI, SQL, and Excel, and I am eager to expand into data visualization, predictive analytics, and machine learning. My goal is to integrate data-driven thinking into the systems I build—whether optimizing blood donation logistics or enhancing educational platforms.

Beyond the technical, I am passionate about using technology to empower communities. I see web development and data science not just as skills, but as tools for impact—whether through educational platforms, healthcare systems, or collaborative outreach initiatives. My journey reflects persistence, problem-solving, and a genuine enthusiasm for mastering the craft of software development and data analytics with purpose.
